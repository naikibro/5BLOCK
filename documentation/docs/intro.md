# 5BLOCK

**Decentralized Pokemon Card Trading on Ethereum**

---

## The Problem with Centralized Trading

Traditional Pokemon card trading platforms operate on centralized servers controlled by corporations. This creates several issues:

- **No True Ownership** - You don't own your cards; you have a license that can be revoked
- **Platform Risk** - If the company shuts down, your collection disappears
- **Artificial Scarcity** - Companies can mint unlimited copies, devaluing your assets
- **Censorship** - Your account can be banned, freezing your cards
- **Opaque Transactions** - No way to verify authenticity or provenance

---

## The 5BLOCK Solution

5BLOCK is a decentralized application (DApp) that brings Pokemon card trading to the Ethereum blockchain, fundamentally changing how ownership works.

### True Ownership

When you mint a card on 5BLOCK, it's recorded on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-721 NFT. **You own it.** No company can take it away, freeze it, or revoke your access. Your private key is the only thing that controls your cards.

### Provable Scarcity

Each of the 151 Generation 1 Pokemon can only be minted **once**. Ever. This isn't artificial scarcity controlled by a company - it's mathematically enforced by smart contract code that anyone can verify.

### Security Through Decentralization

- **Immutable Contracts** - The rules can't change after deployment
- **Transparent Transactions** - Every trade is publicly verifiable on-chain
- **No Single Point of Failure** - The network runs on thousands of nodes worldwide

### Provenance Tracking

Every card tracks its complete ownership history on-chain. You can verify exactly who owned a card before you, creating a permanent record of authenticity.
